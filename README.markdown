JotContent
==========

A content/storage mapping based on Entities and Models. Although the initial storage is a PDO-supporting relational database, the end goal is to be able to use any storage mechanism, for example the file-system or a NoSQL store like Mongo.

This class also implements a Content Envelope pattern.
